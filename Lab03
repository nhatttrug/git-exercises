I KNOW places - Taylor Swift

[Intro]
[Recorder click]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places
